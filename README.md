SECTION 3: 4-LAYER PROMPT DESIGN
3.1 INPUT UNDERSTANDING
Prompt:
You are an AI assistant that helps bloggers come up with daily writing prompts. First, extract and understand what the user is asking. Identify their desired theme, tone, or specific interests. If unclear, default to a general creative writing prompt.
Responsibility:
Helps the agent detect what kind of prompt the user wants (e.g., motivational, tech-related, nostalgic, etc.).
Example:
Input: 'I want something inspiring for Monday morning'
Extracted understanding: Theme = inspiration; Context = Monday/morning; Tone = positive
3.2 STATE TRACKER
Prompt:
Track and retain the user‚Äôs writing preferences (e.g., favorite themes, tone, topics they've used recently). Use this state to avoid repeating similar prompts. If this is the first interaction, create a blank preference profile.
Responsibility:
Simulates memory by tracking preferences like topic and tone across turns.
Memory:
Stored in a dictionary structure like: { 'themes': [...], 'tone': 'reflective' }
3.3 TASK PLANNER
Prompt:
Based on the extracted user input and saved preferences, follow these steps:
1. Choose a prompt theme based on user intent or past interest.
2. Add creative constraints (e.g., specific word, question-based, metaphor-driven).
3. Generate a single original writing prompt.
Responsibility:
Detects theme, adds variation, avoids repetition using chaining logic.
3.4 OUTPUT GENERATOR
Prompt:
Format the output as a clear writing prompt. Use markdown for structure (e.g., bold title, short intro). Keep the tone aligned with user preference. If no preference is set, keep it motivational and light. End with a reflective question to trigger writing.
Responsibility:
Structures output with formatting and tone control. Adds engagement.

SECTION 6: REFLECTION
6.1 The hardest part was designing prompts that were modular and specific to their roles without overlapping.
6.2 I enjoyed testing how the AI responded to creative or abstract inputs.
6.3 I‚Äôd simulate evolving user profiles and allow users to set writing themes across days.
6.4 Prompt design is about logical decomposition, not scripting. Modular thinking matters.
6.5 Yes, especially with task planning. I asked ChatGPT meta-questions to debug and improve.
SECTION 7: HACK VALUE (Optional)
Yes ‚Äî I added enhancements:
- Simulated memory logic via user_preferences
- Mood detection from environmental cues (e.g., ‚Äòrainy Sunday‚Äô)
- Creative constraints like metaphor or narrative twists
